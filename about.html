	<h1>The idea is simple:</h1>
	<h2>We match volunteers with amazing organizations for meaningful projects.</h2>
	<h3>Basic idea:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>As a volunteer: find projects you're interested in with as much commitment you're comfortable with (usually around 3 hours).</li>
		<li>As an organization: list your project, and find amazing talent to help you out.</li>
		<li>Let us do the hard work. We vet and match based on set critieria, including interests, profiles, and past accomplishments.</li>
	</ul>
